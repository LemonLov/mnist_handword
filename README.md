This is an classical network model of handwritten digit recognition whose implementation doesn't use tensorflow or any deep learning framework, just only use python and fully-connected layer. It implement 99% recognition accuracy in training and 97% recognition accuracy in testing at least. It can deepen you comprehension for the forward and backward propagation, aslo min_batch gradient descent and cross entropy. Part of the code is refer to Michael Nielsen's book [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html) and the book's code is in [here](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning). Furthermore, I aslo learn from Andrew Ng's deep learning course in [here](https://mooc.study.163.com/smartSpec/detail/1001319001.htm) and its homework's code. I hope all of this can help you.
